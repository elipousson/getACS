The goal of getACS is to make it easier to work with [American Community Survey data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) from the [tidycensus package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) by Kyle Walker and others.

This package includes:

-   Functions that extend `tidycensus::get_acs()` to support multiple tables, geographies, or years
-   Functions for creating formatted tables from ACS data using the [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/)

Note that I don't love the current name for this package and expect to rename it as soon as I think of a better one.

## Installation

You can install the development version of getACS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/getACS")
```

## Usage

```{r setup}
library(getACS)
library(gt)
library(ggplot2)
```

The main feature of `{getACS}` is support for returning multiple tables, geographies, and years.

```{r}
acs_data <- get_acs_geographies(
  geography = c("county", "state"),
  county = "Baltimore city",
  state = "MD",
  table = "B08134",
  year = 2022,
  quiet = TRUE
)
```

The package also includes utility functions for filtering data and selecting columns to support the creation of tables using the `{gt}` package:

```{r}
tbl_data <- filter_acs(acs_data, indent == 1, line_number <= 10)
tbl_data <- select_acs(tbl_data)

commute_tbl <- gt_acs(
  tbl_data,
  groupname_col = "NAME",
  column_title_label = "Commute time",
  table = "B08134"
)

as_raw_html(commute_tbl)
```

The `gt_acs_compare()` function also allows side-by-side comparison of geographies:

```{r}
commute_tbl_compare <- gt_acs_compare(
  data = tbl_data,
  id_cols = "column_title",
  column_title_label = "Commute time",
  table = "B08134"
)

as_raw_html(commute_tbl_compare)
```

`gt_acs_compare_vars()` is a variant on `gt_acs_compare()` where the default values support comparisons with values in columns and geographical areas in rows:

```{r}
commute_tbl_compare_vars <- acs_data |>
  filter_acs(indent == 1, line_number > 10) |>
  gt_acs_compare_vars(
    table = acs_data$table_id
  )

as_raw_html(commute_tbl_compare_vars)
```


The package also includes several simple functions to support creating plots with the `{ggplot2}` package:

```{r}
plot_data <- acs_data |>
  filter_acs(indent == 1, line_number > 10) |>
  select_acs() |>
  fmt_acs_county(state = "Maryland")

plot_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = perc_estimate, y = column_title, fill = NAME)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_acs_errorbarh(perc = TRUE, linewidth = 0.25, position = "dodge") +
  scale_x_acs_percent() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs_acs_survey(
    y = "Means of transportation to work",
    fill = "Geography",
    table = acs_data$table_id
  )
```
