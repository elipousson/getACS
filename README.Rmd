The goal of getACS is to make it easier to work with [American Community Survey data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) from the [tidycensus package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/). The package includes:

- Helpers for creating tables of ACS data using the [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
- Helpers that extend the existing `tidycensus::get_acs()` function to work with multiple years or geographies

## Installation

You can install the development version of getACS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/getACS")
```
